# Baer_CellProfiler_fitness
Optimization of a CellProfiler pipeline for measuring competitive fitness following Crombie et al. 2018

## README

1. I used example images from `/Users/tim/Dropbox/AndersenLab/LabFolders/Tim/projects/Baer/temp_share/Plate6`
2. I made a well mask to account for the drift in the stage across a row. The stage on Davidâ€™s scope tends jitter well positions in the images. I think the well alignment gets progressively worse when moving across a row. The mask is designed to be conservative and mask the edges of the well no matter where they occur in the image. To make the mask I built a binary image in photoshop by circling well A01, A12, G01 and G10 of a microplate. These wells are slightly shifted from one another so that the intersection of the well boundaries form an ellipse. I then shrunk this shape to 97.5% of its original size to provide a buffer around the well edge. This binary image is loaded with the well images and is applied as a mask saving computational time for each image processed and I think it performs better too.
    1. opened all 4 images in photoshop
    2. made a circle to outline well for G10 perfectly.
    3. Copied that circle to other 3 images to see alignment. - It did not align with other images
    4. Shrunk the circle by 5% and shaped it until the new ellipse fit within the desired well region of all images.
    5. Saved white cirlce with black background as a greyscale png `20220411_mask_v3.png` this is can be used by CellProfiler as a binary image for masking.
3.  Opened the example pipeline from the 2018 paper. Replaced the cropping and background correction modules with updated versions.
    1. I downloaded the supplemental file from Crombie et al. 2018 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195253/bin/pone.0201507.s005.zip](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195253/bin/pone.0201507.s005.zip)
    2. I opened the Andersen Lab CellProfiler pipeline we developed to process our GWA studies. [https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler/tree/master/pipelines](https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler/tree/master/pipelines)
4. **Pipeline 1:** Identifying single worms for the worm model - `/Users/tim/repos/Baer_CellProfiler_fitness/CellProfiler/pipelines/20220411_identify_single_worms.cpproj`
    1. I added 6_A01_PS11_1_BF.tif, 6_A10_PS20_1_BF.tif, 6_G01_PS11_7_BF.tif, 6_G10_PS20_7_BF.tif, and 20220411_mask_v3.png to images module in CP 4.2.1
    2. I used Andersen Lab GWA pipeline as a model to mask the well using `/Users/tim/repos/Baer_CellProfiler_fitness/CellProfiler/mask/20220411_mask_v3.png` and to correct the illumination. The illumination correction is MUCH better than Crombie et al. 2018.

    3. The pipeline finish without fail.
    4. In the untangling step I think we can size select primary objects to focus on non-overlapping L1 - L2 stage animals and avoid debris, adults, and large worm clusters.  
5. **Pipeline 2:** Making a worm model
    1. Used the single worm images from pipeline 1 and processed them with `/Users/tim/repos/Baer_CellProfiler_fitness/CellProfiler/pipelines/20220411_create_worm_model.cpproj` 
    2. Ran without an issue.
6. **Pipeline 3**: Untangling worms and outputting data
    1. The Regular expression that works with our naming is: `^(?P<Plate>.*)(?P<Well>[A-P][0-9]{1,2})(?P<Strain>.*)*(?P<Rep>.*)*(?P<image_type>[A-P][A-P]).tif` 
    2. I am using the Andersen Lab thresholding and well masking approach added to the Crombie et al. 2018 GFP detection approach
    3. I changed the acceptable diameter of worm objects to 10 - 30 to try and select only L1-L2 worms.
    4. I reworked the thresholding strategy used in the IdentifyPrimaryObjects module for GFPobjects. The old method used a manual approach, which might be problematic for a complete image set. The new method is: Minimum Cross-Entropy
        1. This is difficult - I was using the WormmaskedGFP as an input but I think we should use the maskGFP image instead. Also BF worm objects and GFP objects are not aligned with BF objects see major issue below.

        2. The GFP object identification looks good above. See settings below

    5. **MAJOR ISSUE:** The BF and GFP images were not taken successively within a well. This means that many BF worm objects do not align with the GFP objects for the same worm.
    

## General Notes

- CellProfiler 4.2.1 is much more stable than previous versions, e.g., 4.0.3 - 4.0.7
- **MAJOR ISSUE:** The BF and GFP images were not taken successively within a well. This means that many BF worm objects do not align with the GFP objects for the same worm.
